With Penalties for EACH violation being extremely severe and would include up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to 1 million per violation. think about that.... under this abomination that s intended to destroy our First Amendment as well as our Second Amendment rights an American who would post about firearms online would be subject to 20 years Prison and one million dollar fine FOR EACH POST YOU MAKE . It s happening again President Obama is using his imperial pen and telephone to curb your rights and bypass Congress through executive action. Even as news reports have been highlighting the gun control provisions of the Administration s Unified Agenda of regulatory objectives the Obama State Department has been quietly moving ahead with a proposal that could censor online speech related to firearms. This latest regulatory assault published in the June 3 issue of the Federal Register is as much an affront to the First Amendment as it is to the Second. Your action is urgently needed to ensure that online blogs videos and web forums devoted to the technical aspects of firearms and ammunition do not become subject to prior review by State Department bureaucrats before they can be published. To understand the proposal and why it s so serious some background information is necessary. For the past several years the Administration has been pursuing a large scale overhaul of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ITAR which implement the federal Arms Export Control Act AECA . The Act regulates the movement of so called defense articles and defense services in and out of the United States. These articles and services are enumerated in a multi part U.S. Munitions List which covers everything from firearms and ammunition and related accessories to strategic bombers. The transnational movement of any defense article or service on the Munitions List presumptively requires a license from the State Department. Producers of such articles and services moreover must register with the U.S. Government and pay a hefty fee for doing so. Also regulated under ITAR are so called technical data about defense articles. These include among other things detailed design development production or manufacturing information about firearms or ammunition. Specific examples of technical data are blueprints drawings photographs plans instructions or documentation. In their current form the ITAR do not as a rule regulate technical data that are in what the regulations call the public domain. Essentially this means data which is published and which is generally accessible or available to the public through a variety of specified means. These include at libraries open to the public or from which the public can obtain documents. Many have read this provision to include material that is posted on publicly available websites since most public libraries these days make Internet access available to their patrons. The ITAR however were originally promulgated in the days before the Internet. Some State Department officials now insist that anything published online in a generally accessible location has essentially been exported as it would be accessible to foreign nationals both in the U.S. and overseas. With the new proposal published on June 3 the State Department claims to be clarifying the rules concerning technical data posted online or otherwise released into the public domain. To the contrary however the proposal would institute a massive new prior restraint on free speech. This is because all such releases would require the authorization of the government before they occurred. The cumbersome and time consuming process of obtaining such authorizations moreover would make online communication about certain technical aspects of firearms and ammunition essentially impossible. Penalties for violations are severe and for each violation could include up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to 1 million. Civil penalties can also be assessed. Each unauthorized export including to subsequent countries or foreign nationals is also treated as a separate violation. Gunsmiths manufacturers reloaders and do it yourselfers could all find themselves muzzled under the rule and unable to distribute or obtain the information they rely on to conduct these activities. Prior restraints of the sort contemplated by this regulation are among the most disfavored regulations of speech under First Amendment case law. But then when did the U.S. Constitution ever deter Barack Obama from using whatever means are at his disposal to exert his will over the American people and suppress firearm ownership throughout the nation Time is of the essence Public comment will be accepted on the proposed gag order until August 3 2015. Comments may be submitted online at regulations.gov or via e mail at DDTCPublicComments state.gov with the subject line ITAR Amendment Revisions to Definitions Data Transmission and Storage. Finally please contact your U.S. Senators and Member of Congress. Urge them to oppose the State Department s attempt to censor online speech concerning the technical aspects of firearms and ammunition.
